# User Testing

## Validation Surface

**Primary surface:** Tauri v2 desktop app webview, accessible at `http://localhost:24200` during `pnpm tauri dev`.

**Testing tool:** `agent-browser` — connects to the Vite dev server URL to interact with the React UI.

**Setup requirements:**
1. `pnpm tauri dev` must be running (starts both Vite and Tauri)
2. Wait for the webview to load at localhost:24200
3. The scanner runs automatically on startup — wait for sidebar to populate before testing
4. If port `24200` is already occupied, start Tauri with a merged config override on another allowed port in `24200-24210` (for example `pnpm tauri dev -c '{"build":{"beforeDevCommand":"pnpm exec vite --port 24202","devUrl":"http://localhost:24202"}}'`) and point validators at that port.

**Known constraints:**
- Tauri file dialogs (import/export) cannot be tested via agent-browser; test the underlying logic via the UI state changes instead.
- Symlink creation requires actual filesystem access — tests should use a controlled test fixture directory.
- Opening the dev URL in a regular browser does **not** expose Tauri globals (`window.__TAURI__` / `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__` stay undefined), so Tauri-backed state may appear incomplete there. For those cases, validate the native `skills-manage` window itself and capture evidence via macOS window screenshots.

## Validation Concurrency

**Machine:** macOS, 48 GB RAM, 12 CPU cores.

**agent-browser surface:**
- Tauri dev server: ~200 MB RAM
- Each agent-browser instance: ~300 MB RAM
- Available headroom (70% of free): ~29 GB
- **Max concurrent validators: 5**

## Flow Validator Guidance: agent-browser

- Use the shared dev server at `http://localhost:24200` unless the assigned isolation context specifies an alternate port.
- For user-testing validation, run the app with an assigned isolated `HOME` under `/tmp/skills-manage-test-fixtures/` so scanning uses fixture data instead of the real user home.
- Stay within that fixture home and the assigned evidence/output directories; do not inspect or modify real `~/.*skills/` directories.
- For milestone reruns that rely on native macOS Tauri window automation, use a single validator at a time because window focus and AX interactions are global shared state.
- Tauri `app.path().home_dir()` follows the launched process `HOME`, so validators can isolate both the scan roots and `~/.skillsmanage/` database by starting `pnpm tauri dev` with `HOME=/tmp/...`.
- The foundation and platform-views assertions each share one startup scan and one backing SQLite DB under the isolated HOME, so keep each milestone's assertion set serialized inside its assigned validator.
- If the browser preview does not reflect Tauri state, use the native `skills-manage` window as the real user surface and capture evidence with macOS `screencapture` (preferred over Quartz image capture when the latter skews the Tauri window).

## Native macOS Tauri Automation

- When the browser preview lacks Tauri globals and `System Events` AppleScript becomes unreliable, a dependable fallback is Python + PyObjC.
- Install user-local helpers with `python3 -m pip install --user pyobjc-framework-Quartz pyobjc-framework-ApplicationServices pillow`.
- Use `ApplicationServices.AXUIElementCopyAttributeValue` to locate sidebar `AXButton` elements such as `Claude Code 2` or `Central Skills 3`, then trigger navigation with `AXUIElementPerformAction(..., "AXPress")`.
- Prefer macOS `screencapture` for evidence images; Quartz window APIs remain useful for window metadata/selection, but `CGWindowListCreateImage(...)` can skew the captured Tauri pixels for this app.
